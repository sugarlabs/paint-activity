To compile

yum install make gcc python3-devel

make

If you want to use the module outside the activity directory,
move the needed binaries to the right location, it's usually
part of the python sys.path.

mv linux64_311/_fill.so /usr/lib/python3.11/lib-dynload

The libdir indicates the architecture and python version
so you know which you need.

check the directory where the files are placed,
right now only arch and python version are used to create 
the directory name.
gcc incompatible changes will break other configurations.
